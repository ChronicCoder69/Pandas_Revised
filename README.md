# Pandas_Revised
All the important Panda functions and modules used in Data Science for Data Cleaning, analysis and data visualization in one single ipynb file.

We will be doing normalization and Label Encoding on our dataset in panda, for this the dataset That I have chosen is way too Large so , The file "pandas package" is for general understanding, whereas for Label Encoding and Normalization, I have uploaded another ipynb file called "Label_Encoding", so for further, do refer this particular file.

I have applied the same data cleaning methods in this ipynb as well so if you have been through the first file, please skip directly to the "Label Encoding" part, It is already highlighted to save your time.
